For running a simulation just run class **game.Run** in project **sheep_heap-core**.
You also need to set path to native libraries to VM Arguments. 
(In eclipse you can set it Project > Propertities > Run/Debug Settings > Create or edit launch configuration). 
Some more info about running an app you can find in [Kryten](https://github.com/jakub-chatrny/Kryten) repository.
